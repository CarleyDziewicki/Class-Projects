# Othello-Game-CIS500

This othello game was a project for the CIS 500: Fundementals of Software Practice at GVSU. Framework was givin,
however indepdently I completed the implementation for Othello.java.

It is a two player game, with the goal of ending with the most discs of your color.
To play you must place a disc to capture one of your opponets. To capture you must have a disc on either side of one or many of your opponents discs,
either up,down,left,right, or diagonal. If you cannot capture you lose your turn. 

Have fun!
